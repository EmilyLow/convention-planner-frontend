With the Convention Planner, a convention attendee can easily pick and choose from all of the many events on offer, and see their selections neatly laid out on their personal calendar.

This version of the convention scheduler is a hypothetical website for the 2019 [Necronomicon](http://necronomicon-providence.com/welcome/), a convention that celebrates weird fiction. With its wide variety of events — author readings, games, shows, scientific seminars (to include a few) — the Necronomicon does a great job of showing how important it can be for an attendee to be able to narrow down that list to just the events that interest them.

This website utilizes a basic RESTful API, built in Node.js. It can be found [here](https://github.com/EmilyLow/convention-planner-backend).
