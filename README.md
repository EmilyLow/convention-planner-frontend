The Convention Planner is a website that lets convention attendees easily browse through all available events, picking the ones they might want to go to, and see their selections neatly laid out on their personal calendar.

This version of the convention scheduler is a hypothetical website for the 2019 [Necronomicon](http://necronomicon-providence.com/welcome/), a convention that celebrates weird fiction. With its wide variety of events — author readings, games, shows, scientific seminars (to include a few) — the Necronomicon does a great job of showing how important it can be for a convention-goer to be able to narrow down that list to just the events that interest them.

This website utilizes a basic RESTful API, built in Node.js. It can be found [here](https://github.com/EmilyLow/convention-planner-backend).
